An AI tool designed to identify and differentiate between real and manipulated images by using the power of Error Level Analysis (ELA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

The project utilizes ELA to compress images and then compare them with their originals, highlighting areas with potential alterations. These differences which are often invisible to the naked eye, become evident under ELA, revealing brighter or darker regions that suggest manipulation.

The CNN processes the ELA images, learning to recognize patterns associated with authentic and fake images through a training dataset.


TOOLS USED - Jupyter Notebook.
